# clusterprime
A repo for the data pipeline that takes CFHT/MegaPrime data and produces light curves.

Set this up by cloning into a directory, and then in that directory run 'pip install ./ -e'

Only tested in python 3.6.8, and the package versions are specified in the setup script so definitely only do this in a python virtual environment made for specifically this!!
